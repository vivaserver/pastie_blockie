# Objective

Design a http://www.pastie.org clone (with some different features). We'll call the items "blocks" instead of pasties.

I do not expect to see perfect Ruby code since I know you are giving
your first steps with it. What I want to see is how you handle
yourself, how you think and how fast you can learn.

# Specifications:

   * No sign up. Any visitor should be able to use the site.
   * Home page should be a paginated list of public blocks.
   * To create a block one should only enter its contents, language type and whether it is private or public.
   * Anyone should be able to create, edit or delete a block through the site (browser) or through HTTP calls (so that it can be integrated with other applications).
   * Only a block owner can edit or remove a block.
   * Every time a block is edited, a new "revision" is generated. Any revision of a block can be returned (if no revision is specified, then the last revision is returned).

# Requirements:

   * Log with decisions taken
   * Specs/tests
